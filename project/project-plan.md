# Project Plan

## Title
**German Airports in the Global Air Network**

## Description
This project aims to examine the connectivity and operations of German airports within the global air traffic network. By analyzing datasets of German airports and global airline routes, the project seeks to understand Germany's position and influence in international aviation, the key airlines and routes associated with German airports, and the overall network structure of air traffic as it relates to Germany.

## Objectives
- Comparative analysis of German airports within the global aviation network.
- Identification of key airlines and routes operating in German airports.
- Network analysis to map the connectivity of German airports with global destinations.
