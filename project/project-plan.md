# Project Plan

## Title
**Crop Production in India**

## Description
This project aims to analyze the correlation between agricultural crops production based on weather condition in India using the provided dataset. The goal is to identify the most crucial weather parameters affecting crop production, explore the impact of climate change on crop production, and develop actionable insights for farmers and policymakers.

## Objectives
- A list of the most crucial weather parameters affecting crop production
- A quantitative assessment of the impact of climate change on crop production
- Actionable insights for farmers and policymakers to improve crop yields and adapt to climate change
