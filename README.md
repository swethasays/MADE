# German Airports in the Global Air Network Project


## Overview
This project analyzes the role of German airports within the global air travel network. Using multiple datasets, it examines how these airports operate, their international connectivity, and their significance in global aviation. The study integrates data on German airports with information on global airlines, airplanes, and flight routes, providing a view of Germany's impact on worldwide air travel. It provides insights into the operations and global significance of these airports, focusing on their connectivity, airline operations, and aircraft usage.

**Note:** This repository is the result of my participation in the course 'Advanced Methods of Software Engineering' provided by the Professorship of [Open-Source Software from FAU](https://oss.cs.fau.de). The task was to build a Data Engineering Project, which takes at least two public available datasources and processes them with an automated datapipeline, in order to report some findings from the result.
